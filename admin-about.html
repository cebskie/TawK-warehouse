        <br>
        <p>Here are the admin features:</p>
        <h3>1. Transaction Log</h3>
        <p>
            To check a transaction performed by a user, click the transaction button in the navigation bar. 
            You’ll see a table of 10 rows of the most recent transactions done by the users. You can then prepare 
            the product to be taken for out-type transactions, or prepare the storage for in-type transactions.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>2. Register User</h3>
        <p>
            Before a user has access to check products stock and perform transactions, they need to be registered 
            to the system. You can do that by clicking the user button in the navigation bar and type the user’s name, 
            address, and phone number. Once you make sure everything is correct, click the button to add the user 
            to the system. You can also search for any user by the user id or user name. Click the data button, 
            select the search type, then type in the user id or user name. The user’s details will be shown in a table 
            once you click the search button.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>3. Add Product</h3>
        <p>
            If there’s a new product, that has never been registered in product database, you must input 
            the product details first. To add new product, click the product button in the navigation bar, 
            then you can select the category of new product, type the new product’s name, and the price. 
            Once you make sure the details are right, click on the button to add the product to the database.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>4. Check Stock</h3>
        <p>
            To check a product’s stock quantity, just scroll down the stock button in the product page and 
            you’ll be directed to the check stock page. There, you can select the product category and 
            product name. You can then click the button to check the product stock. There will be a table 
            that shows the product name, stock quantity, and product price.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>5. View Insights</h3>
        <p>
            By clicking the insight button in the navigation bar, you can see some reports of the 
            products, such as the stock movement, most popular products, low stock products, and dead stock.
